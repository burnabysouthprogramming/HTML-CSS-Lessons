#HTML Images & Links

##Images
Self-closing tags don't format content or require a closing tag. They are used to embed objects onto the page; they are the content.
Images use a self-closing tag. It also requires a src attribute to tell the browser the location of the image file.

```html
<img src="path/to/image/file-name">
```

alt is another attribute that is added to images to provide alternative text to visually impaired web visitors using screen readers. It is important to use alt all the time.

```html
<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="kitten!">
```

<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="kitten!">

###Image File Paths
This is for using own photos that you have downloaded, otherwise just put url in the src.

It's best practice (but not required) to put image files into its own folder to keep the project files organized.

Since the images are not in the same folder as index.html, use a relative path to link to the file.

```html
<img src="images/image-file.jpg">
```

The starting point (index.html), is outside of the images folder. The above example directs the browser to a folder named images, then the filename, including the file extension.

##Links

Use the anchor tag, ```<a>``` to create the link. It also needs an href attribute to provide information for the location of the resource.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/burnabysouthprogramming/">Coding Club</a>
```
__PREVIEW:__
<a href="https://github.com/burnabysouthprogramming/">Coding Club</a>
<br><br>

To set the link to open in a new window, add a second attribute, target.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/burnabysouthprogramming/" target="_blank">Coding Club</a>
```

Here's the syntax for an email link.
```html
<a href="mailto:hello@myemail.com">hello@myemail.com</a>
```
