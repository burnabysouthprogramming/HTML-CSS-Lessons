#HTML Tags

In the previous lesson, you replicated this code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content here (this is an HTML comment by the way) -->
  </body>
</html>
```
Now I will dissect every part of the code:

```<!DOCTYPE html>``` tag tells the browser what HTML version we are using.

```<html lang="en">...</html>``` tags are always the first HTML tag & identifies the document as HTML. It is the root element & ancestor of all other elements because everything is nested inside. The lang part is for telling the computer the website is in English.

```<head>...</head>``` tags include information about the page but _does not display content_. ```<title></title>``` tags are the only required element because it defines the title of the document and it is displayed in the browser tabs. __Page content never goes in here__.

```<body>...</body>``` tags wrap around all the visible content on your website.

```<!-- ... -->``` is a comment and what you write on the inside will not be read by the computer or shown to any visitors on your site.

##Headers, Sections, Footers in HTML5

In this club, we will be using HTML5. In that version of HTML, there are tags that describe the blocks of content on a website.

Some of you may have heard of ```<div></div>``` which essentially surround blocks of content so you can further manipulate the website. However, div has no meaning so in HTML5, they introduced tags with more meaning.

```html
<body>
  <header>
    header content here
  </header>

  <section>
    section content here
  </section>

  <footer>
    footer / contact info here
  </footer>
</body>
```

Use these tags in the body tag in order to organize your content. It will also make your content into more presentable blocks.

##Paragraphs

Whether it's one sentence or more, each paragraph needs its own pair of ```<p></p>``` tags.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>This is a longer paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Non vero dolor expedita quasi reiciendis minus unde sapiente id eveniet saepe officia quibusdam aspernatur, sint voluptate ipsam ex magni. Aliquam, ex!</p>
```

##Headings
There are six headings tags ranging from ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` used to describe the hierarchy of the page structure. To decide which heading to use, think about how you would arrange an essay outline.

###Essay Title

__Introduction__

__First supporting idea__

* point 1
* point 2

__Second supporting idea__

* point 1
* point 2

__Conclusion__

This is an example where the h1 words will be larger and bolder, while the p elements will be smaller such like a paragraph:
```html
<h1>Essay Title</h1>

<section>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>stuff here</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>First supporting idea</h1>
  <h2>point 1</h2>
  <h2>point 2</h2>
</section>
```
