#CSS Introduction

CSS is:
* different language from HTML
* stylesheet language with its own syntax rules
* used to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
* stylesheet contains a list of rules

CSS requires these symbols: curly brackets ```{ }```, colon ```:```, semi-colon ```;```

##Syntax

__Selectors:__ determines which HTML element(s) to apply the styles to.

__Declarations:__ style rules written in property:value pairs, are wrapped by curly brackets ```{ }``` and must end with a semi-colon ```;```
```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

__Properties__ determine the type of style to be applied (e.g. color). __Values__ are specific to the property (red).
```css
p {
  color: red;
  background-color: green;
}
```

##Referencing CSS
We'll be creating a separate style sheet file for the CSS. 

To create a stylesheet, just name the file with a ```.css``` file extension.

The style sheet is then referenced within the ```<head>``` of the HTML document (different tag from ```<header>```).

Use ```<link>``` tag and two attributes, ```rel``` and ```href```.

```html
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
```

Though not required, css files are often saved in a separate folder for organization, just like images.
