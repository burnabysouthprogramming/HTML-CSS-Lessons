#Practice Exercise

1. Use the HTML page from earlier and add a table/a few tables, if it is applicable to your site.
2. Add a list or couple of lists, if applicable.
3. Create a CSS page within your project folder that is in its own CSS folder.
4. Link the CSS page to the HTML page.

Today is a shorter day to wrap up on HTML, so it's a day to figure out the structure of your page and to search up/ask anything concerning HTML if you have any questions.

You can search up CSS properties and values if you have extra time, or work on your own stuff.
